<pre><code>* -> Security Fix
# -> Bug Fix
$ -> Language fix or change
+ -> Addition
^ -> Change
- -> Removed
! -> Note
</code></pre>

<h2>Changelog Location</h2>

<p>The main changelog for ZOO can be found by visiting <em>/administrator/components/com_zoo/README.md</em>. All ZOO modules have their own changelog which can be found in each module folder <em>/modules/MODULENAME/CHANGELOG.md</em></p>

<div class="box-warning">While all efforts are made to keep the changelog up to date and accurate, it should be considered non-exhaustive and proper file comparison tools should be used to locate any modifications that may conflict with your installation.</div>
