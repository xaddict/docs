<h1 class="title">Widget Plugins</h1>

<p>
    A widget plugin determines how your widget will be displayed in the frontend, for example as a Slideshow or a Grid. You can also add custom widget plugins. Each plugin accepts a set of configuration parameters. These can be set using the visual interface provided by Widgetkit or by changing the shortcode directly.
</p>

<h2>Gallery</h2>

<p>
    The gallery widget displays images and videos in a grid, automatically creating thumbnails for your media items. Use the widget configuration to change the appearance of the gallery.
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Layout</td>
            <td>Configure the behavior of the gallery grid, the number of columns for different screen sizes (for responsive behaviour) and add animations to the gallery items.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Content</td>
            <td>Determine how content and media of all items are rendered. In the <em>Media</em> section you can configure different Overlay appearances.<br>
            <span class="badge">NOTE</span> The link to display the <em>Read more button</em> as well as the <em>Social Buttons</em> can be added in the {doc:content-manager text:Content Manager} and through {doc:manage-fields text:Custom fields} when creating the content.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Lightbox</td>
            <td>Enable a lighbox to display your media fully sized or set a fixed width and height. You can use the title or the content field as a text caption.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>General</td>
            <td>Display or hide specific parts of your content. You can also set a custom HTML class that will be added to the widget element in the rendered output.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Example Shortcode</h3>

<p>Default gallery widget. Content items will have 100% each and will therefore be stacked. The content is displayed in an image caption and the overlay content is an icon.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="gallery"]</code></pre>

<p>A gallery widget that displays 4 columns on large screens automatically collapses to 2 columns on tablets and such and displays a single column on all devices smaller than that. To understand this mobile first approach, have a look at the <a href="http://getuikit.com/docs/grid.html#responsive-width">UIkit responsive grid</a> that is used here. The overlay is centered and title, content as well as the read more and lightbox links, which are displayed as small buttons, are located inside the overlay.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="gallery" columns_medium="2" columns_large="4" overlay="center" buttons="icon-small"]</code></pre>

<h2>Grid</h2>

<p>
    In a Grid widget, all items will be displayed as single items of a grid. The height of grid items can be matched or displayed in a dynamic grid, always applying the same spacing between items regardless of their height.
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Layout</td>
            <td>Configure the behavior of the grid, number of columns for different screen sizes (for responsive behaviour) and set the panel appearance. The gutter property determines the spacing between columns and rows.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Content</td>
            <td>Configure how content items and their optionally attached media are rendered. <br>
            <span class="badge">NOTE</span> The link to display the <em>Read more button</em> as well as the <em>Social Buttons</em> can be added in the {doc:content-manager text:Content Manager} and through {doc:manage-fields text:Custom fields} when creating the content.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>General</td>
            <td>Display or hide specific parts of your content. You can also set a custom HTML class that will be added to the widget element in the rendered output.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Example Shortcode</h3>

<p>Default grid widget. Content items will have 100% each and will therefore be stacked.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="grid"]</code></pre>

<p>A dynamic grid widget that displays 4 columns on large screens automatically collapses to 2 columns on tablets and such and displays a single column on all devices smaller than that. To understand this mobile first approach, have a look at the <a href="http://getuikit.com/docs/grid.html#responsive-width">UIkit responsive grid</a> that is used here.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="grid" grid="dynamic" columns_medium="2" columns_large="4"]</code></pre>

<h2>Grid Stack</h2>

<p>
    In a Grid stack, all items from your selected content will be rendered below each other. This can easily be used for a paired display of an image (taken from the media field of your content item) and a short text (taken from the content field of your content item).
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Layout</td>
            <td>Configure the appearance of the grid, for example the relation of content and media. The grid gutter determines the spacing between items in the grid. You can individually set animations for the media and content columns.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Content</td>
            <td>Configure how content items and their attached media are rendered.<br>
            <span class="badge">NOTE</span> The link to display the <em>Read more button</em> as well as the <em>Social Buttons</em> can be added in the {doc:content-manager text:Content Manager} and through {doc:manage-fields text:Custom fields} when creating the content.</td>

            <td>Display or hide specific parts of your content. You can also set a custom HTML class that will be added to the widget element in the rendered output.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Example Shortcode</h3>

<p>Default grid stack widget.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="grid-stack"]</code></pre>

<p>A grid stack widget with dividers between the items, the media elements cropped to circles and are animated to slide in when the item scrolls into view.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="grid-stack" divider=1 animation_media="slide" animation_content="slide" media_border="circle"]</code></pre>

<h2>Map</h2>

<p>
    A map widget displays a Google map on your website. Make sure to add a custom field <em>Location</em> to your content element and select a location you want to display in the map. The other fields of your content will be displayed when you click on the location marker. You can add several pins and popup boxes by adding more items to your content element. For more information, read the {doc:manage-fields text:Manage fields} doc.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Popup</td>
            <td>Configure the popup that is shown at the location marker. You can individually set animations for the media and content columns.<br>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Example Shortcode</h3>

<p>A simple map widget. Make sure the content (#23 in the example) has a custom field added for the location.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="map"]</code></pre>

<p>A map showing the satellite image view and without any controlling UI elements.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="map" maptypeid="SATELLITE" disabledefaultui=1]</code></pre>

<h2>Slideshow</h2>

<p>
    A slideshow turns your selected content element into a sequence of slides. Each item in your content element will represent one slide. Select a media element as the slide's background. The title and content fields can be displayed in an overlay on top of that image.
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Slideshow</td>
            <td>Configure the appearance and behaviour of the slideshow. Settings for the navigation and animations can be found here as well as the option to enable a fullscreen slideshow.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Content</td>
            <td>Here you you can set the image proportions and enable an overlay. The overlay content is taken from the title and content fields in your content item.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>General</td>
            <td>Display or hide specific parts of your content. You can also set a custom HTML class that will be added to the widget element in the rendered output.</td>

<p>A slideshow with captions enabled and animations for slides and a centered overlay.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="23" widget="slideshow" animation="swipe" overlay=1 overlay_position="center"]</code></pre>

<h2>Switcher</h2>

<p>
    A switcher consists of a number of navigation toggles and their related content items. Switchers are useful for realizing little tabbed navigations and similar. Each item in your selected content element will result in a navigation entry.
</p>

<table class="zebra">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>
          <th>Description</th>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Layout</td>
            <td>Configure the appearance and behavior of the switcher. The navigation can be of different visual appearance and can be be positioned at any side of the content.</td>
        </tr>
            <td>Content</td>
            <td>Configure how content items and their optionally attached media are rendered.<br>
            <span class="badge">NOTE</span>  The link to display the <em>Read more button</em> as well as the <em>Social Buttons</em> can be added in the {doc:content-manager text:Content Manager} and through {doc:manage-fields text:Custom fields} when creating the content.</td>
