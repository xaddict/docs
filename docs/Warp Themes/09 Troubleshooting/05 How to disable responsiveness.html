<h1 class="title">How to disable responsiveness</h1>

<p class="article-lead">Learn how to turn off the viewport meta tag and edit the breakpoints to disable the responsive layout.</p>

<h2>1. Viewport meta tag</h2>

<p>Check the <em>Disable the viewport meta tag</em> checkbox in your <em>Settings -&gt; Responsive</em> menu of the theme settings. This will set the default width of the mobile layout to <em>980px</em> and the site will look the same as on desktops.</p>

<h2>2. Breakpoints</h2>

<p>The next step is to give the breakpoints minimal and maximal values to prevent the responsive behavior of the layout. To do so, open the customizer and set the <code>Mini</code>, <code>Small</code>, <code>Medium</code> and <code>Large</code> breakpoints to <em>0px</em>. The <code>Xlarge</code> breakpoint needs to be set as high as possible, like <em>9999px</em>. This will make it impossible for the browser to respond to the breakpoints.</p>

<h2>3. Less</h2>

<p>You need to add the following css code to the <code>/less/theme.less</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>.uk-container {
    max-width: none;
    with: @utility-container-max-width;
}</code></pre>
