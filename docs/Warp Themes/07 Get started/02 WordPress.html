<p class="article-lead">This tutorial gives you a brief overview of the general WordPress and Warp framework setup.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Setting up a Warp theme follows the standard WordPress installation procedure and works like with any other theme.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download WordPress from the <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress website</a>.</li>
  <li>Setup a new WordPress install.</li>
  <li>Install and activate your theme.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, take a look at the official <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/">WordPress documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Setup a demo package</h3>

<p>A demo package is a full WordPress installation, which includes the theme, and sample data responsible for the layout and setup of our demo. This is great, if you don't want to start from scratch or just to have a peek at how everything is put together.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>If the installation does not work and you get an error message, you might want try installing the theme manually.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Extract the theme <code>.zip</code> file to a directory on your PC.</li>
  <li>Using FTP, upload the theme directory to the directory <code>wp-content/themes/</code> on your webserver.</li>
  <li>Go to <em>Appearance &gt; Themes</em> in the WordPress administration and the new theme will appear in the overview of installed themes.</li>
  <li>Hit <em>Activate</em> to activate the newly installed theme.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can find further guidance on troubleshooting and PHP problems in the {doc: installation-issues-2 text: Installation issue} article.

<h2>Setup the menus</h2>

  <p>First of all, you need to create a new menu and add your menu items. For detailed instructions, see the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Menu_User_Guide">WordPress documentation</a>. Select your menu in the box <em>Theme Locations</em> on the left and hit <em>Save</em> to assign it as the main navigation of your site.</p>

<h3>Widget in menu position</h3>

<p>You can also publish any widget in the <em>menu</em> position. The widget name is used as menu item and the widget content appears in the dropdown.</p>

<h3>Menu styles</h3>

<p>There are three different menu styles, the <em>Mega dropdown menu</em> as a main menu, the <em>Accordion menu</em> in sidebars and the <em>Line menu</em> in the toolbar or footer. Warp automatically styles the menu according the position it is published in.</p>

<h2>Setup the logo</h2>

<p>Setting up the logo in WordPress is pretty straightforward. Just create a <em>Text widget</em> in the <em>Logo</em> position. Now you can edit your widget and enter your markup.</p>
<p>For example use following code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src&#61;"wp-content/uploads/logo.png" width&#61;"200" height&#61;"50" alt&#61;"logo" /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Warp 7 also provides the <code>logo-small</code> position, where you can display an alternative logo image for smaller viewport sizes.</p>
<p><span class="badge">NOTE</span> If the logo image is not visible on all pages, just add a leading slash before the image path, e.g.: <code>/wp-content/uploads/logo.png</code>.</p>
