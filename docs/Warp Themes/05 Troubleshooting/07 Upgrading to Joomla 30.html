<div class="box-info">If no update was found, you need to need to purge the cache by going to <em>Extensions</em> -> <em>Extension Manager</em> -> <em>Update</em> and click on <em>Purge Cache</em>. Then just go back to <em>Joomla! Update</em>.</div>

<h2>Upgrade the theme</h2>

<p>To update the theme you need to download the latest Joomla 3.0 theme from our <a href="/themes/downloads" title="Theme Downloads">download directory</a> and replace the theme folder of your current 2.5 theme <em>/templates/yoo_templatename</em> with the new one.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you have already done a lot of modifications to your the theme, you can also just replace the <em>warp</em> folder with the 3.0 theme warp folder.</p>

<h2>Upgrade the extensions</h2>

<p>If you have Widgetkit or ZOO installed just re-install the new version for Joomla 3.0 in the Joomla extension manager.</p>
